# Spotify-Song-Analysis-Classification
A classification problem of song popularity


## üå± Motivation

Main motivation for this project is to do a full data analysis project including setting up a data retrieval pipeline from scratch, analyzing and gaining insights from data using Python and SQL as well as data modeling using machine learning algorithm.


## üìÅ Datasets

 Data was built using + [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)


## üìì Notebooks
Project was divided into three notebooks namely:

* Project - Data Pre-processing: Generating dataset with the use of spotipy api and data cleaning and pro-processing
* Data EDA AND VISUALIZATION WITH DATA FINALIZING: Data insights and visualization of necessary insights
* Project - Prediction and Classifications: Classification using Logistics and Decision tree and model evaluation on generated dataset.


## Tools:

* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - data analysis
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - data visualization
* [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/) - access to Spotify Web API
* [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.2.2/) - storage in HDFS
* [Pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.mllib.html) - model training using mlib classifiers
